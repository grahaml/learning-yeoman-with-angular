# Learning to use Yeoman and Angular

This repository contains the full gamut of code from the [Yeoman codelab](http://yeoman.io/codelab.html) tutorial, which I have altered to my liking. It's a sandbox for me to play around with Yeoman and Angular.

## Plans for this reposiitory

* Making some subgenerators for
    - forms
    - views
* Making the todo app more useful
* General tomfoolery
